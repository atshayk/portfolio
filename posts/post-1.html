      <p>It all started with a tiny change. Just one line of code. But it turned into a very long night.</p>
        <section class="gap"></section>
      <h3>Act 1: The Commit</h3>
      <p>I was working on a simple feature ‚Äî add a new field to the user profile. I made the change, pushed it to production... and suddenly, our user dashboard wasn't loading. Oops.</p>
        <p>My first thought? "This can't be happening." But it was. I had just broken production.</p>
        <section class="gap"></section>
      <h3>Act 2: Chaos Ensues</h3>
      <p>Logs started filling up with errors. Slack blew up. The team was pinging me. I scrambled to roll back the change, but I'd already nuked half the cache. My heart rate? 180 bpm.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I learned how to triage a live incident.</li>
            <li>I learned to test even the smallest changes properly.</li>
            <li>And I learned our backup system actually works (thank god).</li>
        </ul>
      <section class="gap"></section>
      <h3>Act 3: The Fix</h3>
      <p>We spent the next few hours restoring service, adding tests, and writing a postmortem. It was a mess ‚Äî but one of the most educational messes I've been in.</p>

      <blockquote>‚ÄúMistakes are proof you're trying.‚Äù</blockquote>
      <section class="gap"></section>
      <p>In the end, everything was fine. We shipped the fix, updated our deploy process, and I got some sleep. But I'll never forget what it felt like to break production ‚Äî and bounce back.</p>

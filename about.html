          <p>A developer with a love for building fun, impactful, and sometimes chaotic things on the internet.</p>
          <p> Whether it's a tool to help someone out or a quirky side project that sparks joy, I like making tech that feels human. </p>
          <p>I started coding in 2019 with Python and SQL, and since then, I've fallen down every rabbit hole I could find — web dev, bots, game engines like Godot, you name it. I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science, but most of my learning has happened outside the classroom: through curiosity, side projects, and breaking things just to understand how they work.</p>
          <p>Right now, I'm focused on fullstack projects and using tech to support underserved communities. I believe in learning through building — and messing up a few times along the way.</p>

      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <div class="about-text">
          <p> I want to build software that actually matters — tools and apps that solve real problems, make life easier, and feel good to use. Clean, simple, and built with people in mind. I'm always thinking about the future too, making sure what I create lasts and stays useful.</p>
          <p> To me, coding isn't just about logic or syntax — it's about creativity, empathy, and making a difference, even in small ways. I like bringing ideas to life, blending the technical with the human side of things. If I can help someone, make something smoother, or spark a little joy through what I build, that's a win in my book.</p>

            <p> I first dipped my toes into programming with QBASIC in the 8th grade, thought it was cool, and then… completely forgot about it.</p>
            <p> ... Years later, like many Indian students, I had to pick between medicine and engineering. The thought of studying for 14 more years made the choice pretty easy. (No offense, doctors.)</p> 
            <p> And so I took the plunge into coding with Python, mostly out of curiosity and a desire to figure out how things worked under the hood. What began as a bunch of small experiments quickly turned into a passion — I've been building, breaking, and learning ever since.</p>
            <p> So I picked up Python out of curiosity, and that little spark turned into something real. Since then, I’ve been building, breaking, and learning non-stop — from one project to another, bouncing between stacks, and figuring things out as I go.</p>
            <p> It's been a hands-on, curiosity-fueled journey, and I'm still just getting started.</p>

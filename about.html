          <p>Hi! I'm Anis Timur Shayk, a developer with a love for building fun, impactful, and sometimes chaotic things on the internet.</p>
          <p>I started programming in 2019 with Python and SQL, and since then I've fallen down every rabbit hole I could find — from web development to bots to game engines like Godot.</p>
          <p>I recently graduated in Computer Science, and I'm currently focused on fullstack projects and making tech accessible to underserved communities.</p>
          <p>Outside of code, I like to sketch, write stories, and debate ideas. I believe in learning through building — and messing up a few times along the way.</p>

      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <div class="about-text">
          <p> I want to build software that actually matters — tools and apps that solve real problems, make life easier, and feel good to use. Clean, simple, and built with people in mind. I'm always thinking about the future too, making sure what I create lasts and stays useful.</p>
          <p> To me, coding isn't just about logic or syntax — it's about creativity, empathy, and making a difference, even in small ways. I like bringing ideas to life, blending the technical with the human side of things. If I can help someone, make something smoother, or spark a little joy through what I build, that's a win in my book.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <div class="about-text">
            <p> First got exposed to the programming world with QBASIC in my 8th grade, decided that I must become a programmer and then I totally forgot about it.</p>
            <p> ...Years later, I found myself at a crossroads to pick between <i class="fa-solid fa-prescription-bottle-medical"></i>medicine and <i class="fa-solid fa-wrench"></i>engineering as most Indian students do and I decided that studying for 14 years didn't sound so good. No offense, doctors. 
            <p> And so I took the plunge into coding with Python, mostly out of curiosity and a desire to figure out how things worked under the hood. What began as a bunch of small experiments quickly turned into a passion — I've been building, breaking, and learning ever since.</p>
            <p> Along the way, I've dabbled in different tech stacks, worked on all kinds of side projects, and built apps that range from personal tools to projects with real social impact. I've never really stuck to just one lane — I enjoy exploring and learning by doing, even if it means going off the beaten path. Most of what I know has come from self-teaching, online communities, and a lot of trial and error outside of traditional academic settings.</p>
            <p> It's been a hands-on, curiosity-fueled journey, and I'm still just getting started.</p>
